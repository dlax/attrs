Rework handling of `functools.cached_property` in slotted classes by defining a `__getattribute__()` method instead of `__getattr__()` previously.
While this is closer to the guidance for [customizing attribute access](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-attribute-access), this fixes inheritance resolution of cached properties in slotted classes when subclasses are not attr-decorated but define a custom `__getattr__()` method.
